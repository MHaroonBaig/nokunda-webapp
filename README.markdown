NoKunda is a combo of web and android app which aims to solve power theft issues via crowd-sourcing, i.e, by mobilizing and empowering the citizens.

Any citizen can report power line taps (Kundas) or meter tampering anonymously, with GPS location and picture of the site as proof. 
That means, if you're walking down a street and you spot a 'Kunda' somewhere, you can just pull out your mobile, take a photo and the report will be published on a centralized Map.

All theft reports will be shown on a Google Map, visible to all citizens as well as government authorities which will help in transparency and citizen-coordination.

NoKunda is an opensource application, derived from the Ushahidi opensource platform.
