NoKunda is a combo of web and android app which enables precise power theft reporting on the go, anonymously BUT with proof!

That means, if you're walking down a street and you spot a 'Kunda' somewhere, you can just pull out your mobile, take a photo and the report will be published with GPS coordinates on a centralized map, visible to all citizens and government authorities enabling transparency.

Alternatively reports can also be added via WEB, with picture & exact position specified on a map.
